## Intro

**Go over the information and really understand it, then go out and apply it, bit by bit. Mastering each point will establish a certainty that you can do it.**

**Attention**

Attention has its limits. Each person has a certain amount of it. When you first began to ride you probably spent 90 percents of your attention on how to let out the clutch without stalling. When you've ridden for years you probably spend only one on it.
