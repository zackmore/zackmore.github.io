## 1) The Basics: Braking and Steering

If you ride at 100mph, practice stopping from 100 mph and make it part of your riding ritual.

Practicing your braking will put you in touch with your bike's ability to shed speed quickly, which is a valuable point of reference when you begin using your brakes for more subtle speed changes at corner entrance. You'll learn the importance of maximum deceleration in which the tires are howling and near lock-up, but it's also important to master the fine-touch applications of braking, especially for trail-braking and other more complicated techniques. **You must become comfortable with your brakes.**

### Practice Stops.

Pick a clean, deserted stretch of pavement, wear your best riding gear and practice stopping. **The goal is repeatable stops at the threshold of front and rear tire lock-up.** Notice the weight transfer forward as the bike begins braking.

1. Begin slowly and carefully by making a few easy stops.
2. **Studies show the fastest, shortest stops come from using both brakes.**
3. **Use two fingers, the index and middle fingers on the front brake lever.**
4. **Squeeze the front brake lever like you'd squeeze the trigger of a gun -- never grab it.**
5. **Develop the habit of resting your fingers on the front brake lever anytime the throttle is not wide open.**
6. **Experiment with rear brake pedal pressure.** Don't jab at it; push it down gently until you hear the rear tire howl just before lock-up or feel the back end become squirmy. Locking the rear brake for a short time isn't a problem and may be unavoidable, and I hope you have already experimented with this as part of your braking practice. **A locked-up rear brake can be dealt with in two ways: Leave it locked and steer with handlebar to keep the bike upright and straight, or immediately get off the brake to get the rear tire turning again.** In a true emergency, you might not have the mental capacity to relieve rear brake pressure, so practice locking up the brake and steering. Sounds like a great thing to try on a dirt bike first!

## 2) Steering Clear

**Counter Steering** means push / pull at the handlebar for steering and recovering.

Once you wrap your mind around the basic countersteering principle, you're open to the almost infinite variations possible when steering a sport bike. Suddenly, quick steering isn't just a way to avoid an accident, it's the secret to precision sport riding. Like braking, steering skills can be endlessly polished with an attendant improvement in your riding ability.

The faster you go, the greater the gyroscopic effect of the tires, wheels, chain, discs, etc., which means it takes more effort to deflect them off their chosen path.

### Lessons From The Racetrack

1. **Feel The Rheostat** Brake feel is more important than outright braking power because racers will use their brakes deep into the corner when necessary. It's called *trail-braking*. Quit thinking that the brake lever is an on/off switch and treat it like a speed rheostat.
2. **Clean The Discs**
3. **Less Rear Brake Is More** A race bike's rear brake shouldn't lock up no matter how hard the rider stands on it.
4. **Change The Fluid** Heat and moisture reduce the brake fluid's boiling point. **Think about changing your brake fluid three times a year if you ride year-round. Never reuse clutch or brake fluid, and keep your brake fluid bottle tightly sealed.**

## 3) The Eyes

### Target Fixation

is where your body and motorcycle follow your eyes.

**In sport riding, you need to reprogram your eyes to look at the world correctly and to focus on where you need to be. You need to look to the path you want your bike to follow. Target fixation is okay -- if you pick the right targets.**

1. Resist the urge to stare at the rider you're following, whethere on the street or track. Your main focus must remain on where you want your bike to be and what obstacles you are approaching, which your peripheral vision and an occassional quick glance are used to maintain the other rider's position as you ride.
2. If you fix your gaze on any single problem, you put yourself in jeopardy of missing other threatening situations. Move your eyes! Most of us don't move our eyes quickly enough.
3. The process of avoiding obstacles involves three steps -- **S**(earch) **E**(valuate) **E**(xecute)

**Visualize the proper line through corners and use your eyes to trace a path along the road and follow it.** So when a car turns left in front of you, look to your escape route, not to the car's front bumper. When there's sand across the corner, look to the clearest path through it. If you're up in the mountains riding quickly, ignore the panoramic view and concentrate only on the road. Get tough with your eyes. Use them to look past a crashing rider, a beautiful view or a pothole. Use them to put your bike exactly where you want it to be.

**Using your eyes correctly is critical in choosing the path you want your motorcycle to follow. You must discipline yourself to look where you want to go. Look to the escape route. Look to the clear path. You're training yourself to look away from two objects that can hurt you and refocus your sight on a safe way through.** Sounds simple reading it in a book, but at 50 mph it's a challenging mind game.

Proper use of the eyes is vital to a motorcyclist in terms of safety and survival. And how you interpret what your eyes are telling you makes the difference between an experienced rider and a fresh-faced rookie. Use your eyes correctly and you'll be safer, smoother and faster.

Using your eyes comes down to one thing: **mental discipline**.

A real-world street example illustrates the proper visual techniques when riding in a group. Many of us find ourselves focusing on the bike directly ahead of us, its tires or perhaps the rider's helmet. **Wrong**. When riding through corners in close quarters, look ahead of the bike you're following to avoid surprises like debris or traffic. If you're following closely, shift your focus ahead of the bike you're following and use your peripheral vision to maintain the proper following distance.

### Look Up The Road

Most riders focus just ahead of their front wheel, and that gives an incredible sense of speed because ground's rushing past really fast. If you get your eyes up and look farther up the road, everything slows down and you don't feel as overwhelmed by the speed. **By looking up the road or through the corner, you'll reduce your perceived speed and give yourself more time to make the proper decisions and control inputs.** It's a racers technique and will make a huge different in your sport riding.

### Keep Your Eyes Moving

Scan constantly, moving your eyes from the path immediately in front of you to the farthest point you can see in the corner; as the corner unwinds in front of you, continue to scan to the farthest point. **Never look so far up the road that you miss potentially dangerous obstacles in your path.**

Mastering this technique required shifting your eyes from a particular section of road or even a section of a corner. For instance, as you approach a corner, you will be looking at a spot at the corner entrance, probably where you think it's a good place to turn. Leave your eyes on that spot too long, however, and the rest of the corner will either surprise you or rush you. **Move your eyes off that entrance point and up into the corner, looking for your apex point, or the point at which you come closest to the edge of your lane. As you approach that spot, rip your eyes up again to the exit. Move them. Jump them off anything that threatens to grab your attention, like a crack in the pavement or a rock in the road.**

### Peripheral Power

Peripheral vision is one of the most vital attributes needed by every rider. Think of peripheral vision as an awareness, one that can be enlarged and strengthened. What we're talking about is seeing without fixating, viewing without staring, gathering information that you may have previously overlooked.

### Eye Drill: Vision Revision

1. **Walk down the sidewalk and while staring straight ahead, count the cracks as they pass underfoot.** This test is especially important for riders because you must monitor your current situation (couting the crack) at the same time as you are looking ahead.
2. **Stare into a crowd and, which maintaining a single focal point, try to pick up all movement with your peripheral vision.** Developing this ability will help you move through traffic with your eyes looking ahead while maintaining enough peripheral strength to detect movement anywhere in your field of view.
3. **When watching TV, look at the corner of the screen and attempt to watch the show with your peripheral vision. Use th same technique when following another rider. Look ahead of the leading rider's bike (when following relatively closely), yet maintain the leader's position in your peripheral vision. What you want to avoid is staring at the leading rider or bike.**
4. **Close this book momentarily, then pop it open to any page and close it again immediately. How much did you read? How much of a photo did you see? Keep trying it, and work on expanding that quick bite of information.** This becomes important while scanning traffic, glancing in your mirror or checking over your shoulder. Use your peripheral vision to soak in as much information as possible, in as short a time as possible. Try to capture the scene the instant you view it. This becomes especially helpful for those quick glances in the mirror prior to a lane change in heavy traffic.

### Look Ahead

1. Learn to **constantly scan back and forth from the bike's front tire to the farthest point you can comfortablely see** rather than just swivel your eyes to the horizon.
2. **The only way to fine-tune the way you operate your bike's controls is to give yourself more time**. That means scanning farther ahead, extending your vision up the road to see corners, bumps and stop signs. If you don't get your eyes up, you'll be continually late and hurried with the controls of your bike and continually surprised by events you should have seen early and planned for accordingly. **Riding smoothly is an excellent goal for street riders, and smoothness begins when the eyes look up for the big picture**. The next time something surprises or shocks you, I bet your eyes will be at fault.
3. Be sure to **keep your eyes moving**, get them off the entrance to the middle of the corner and, as you approach the middle, look to the exit. **Make the eyes' movements smooth and controlled**. **The faster you ride, the farther you'll need to look ahead of your bike**.

### Self-analysis

1. Running wide in a corner -> eyes quit looking through th corner. **Keep your eyes moving ahead of the bike.**
2. Hitting stationary objects -> target fixtation.
3. Being late on the throttle. **Applying the throttle (lightly) as early as possible after turning into a corner is a critical aspect of riding well.**
4. Being overwhelmed and surprised -> focusing too close to front tire. **Look Ahead**.
5. Entering a corner far too slowly. While braking for a corner, it's easy to leave your eyes on whatever you were using to gauge your speed and braking distance, and your entrance speed suffers. You stay on the brakes too long because you need your eyes to look into the corner to correctly gauge the corner's radius, pavement, etc. Isn't it interesting to find that one of the main secrets to good entrace speed is the eyes?

## 4) Steer That Thing

### Push And Pull

As the bike's speed increases, the gyroscopic effect of its spinning wheels creates ever-increasing stablility. So a bike traveling at 80 mph requires more muscle at the handlebar to steer than it would at 30 mph.

Push lightly on the inside bar, and the bike lazes into the corner. Punch a the inside bar, and the bike snaps over a bit too uncontrollably. Push on the inside bar and pull on th outside bar, and the effect is sensational; the combined push and pull serve to put the bike into a lean angle almost effortlessly.

**Notice how much effort you need to turn the bike at higher speeds. Practice pushing and pulling on the handlebar to help overcome the gyroscopic effoects of the wheels.**

### Row, Don't Punch

**Smooth, relaxed hands are a key ingredient for good riding inputs. With that in mind, don't overpower the handlebar during direction changes. Don't punch or lunge at the grips, but push and pull them in a smooth, controlled motion.** You can certainly turn a fast-moving bike aggressively, but too much aggression will have the chassis out of shape as the fork and shock springs rebound after the bike is "thrown" into the corner. Anytime you're waiting for your chassis to settle down, you're basically out of control. Back off the muscular handlebar inputs and your smoothness will pay off in better chassis manners, improved tire wear and reduced heart rate.

### Force At The Handgrips

Because teh handgrips are teh main steering points, it makes sense to reduce the amount of extra weight, or force, being carried by the bars. **Using your stomach, back and chest muscles to hold yourself in place will greatly reduce the amount of weight borne by the handlebar, allowing you to further refine the force used for steering the bike.** It becomes abundantly clear why professional roadracers work out so frequently, and why torso strength is a main focus of their efforts.

**Relax. Let your elbows hang naturally, not tucked in or flying out aggressively. Keep your eyes level with the horizon, not tilted with bike. Relax your spine, because as soon as you sit bolt upright, your elbows will lock and you'll lose front-end feel.**

Every movement of the front end moves those clenched arms and consequently disrputes the bike's stability. While it takes some muscle to push and pull on the handlebar, you must keep a relaxed grip and fight the urge to strangle the handgrips. Learn to make a direction change and then relax to let the bike remain settled and stable rather than induce problems with a too-tight grip. This further emphasizes the importance of torso strength, because it's the stomach and back muscles that allow you to take your weight off your arms, and off the handgrips.

**Consciously remind yourself to relax.** Not only will your bike feel more planted on the road, you'll gain more traction information from the tires, allowing you to improve everything from cornering speed to lean angle. If you continue to hang on too tightly, you'll never read that your bike is trying to tell you, and any riding improvement will be much tougher to realize.

### Additianal Steering Secrets

1. Throttle Steering

  A motorcycle's throttle controls speed, but what you're focusing on here is the throttle's effect on lean angle. Using the throttle to modulate lean angle will allow you to relax your grip on the bars, which in turn will allow you to feel more of what the front tire is trying to tell you about traction. The end result is an increase in your speed, safety and confidence as you ride. Since the throttle can modulate your elan angle, the ned to push and pull at the handlebar is reduced.

  **Your bike will fall into a corner when the throttle is closed (off-throttle), it will stand up out of the corner when the throttle is rolled open (on-throttle) and will hold a constant lean angle when the throttle is slightly cracked open (maintain throttle).**

  You're enter the corner *off-throttle* and initiate the turn. The bike banks into the corner and continues to fall because the throttle is closed. As you reach the lean angle necessary to make the apex of the corner a the speed you've chosen, **you can push on the outside bar to arrest the increasing lean angle. Or you can crack open the throttle to maintenance to achieve th same effect.** Going to maintenance throttle at this point will be a much smoother way of arresting the lean angle, and as the corner opens up, you can simply roll the throttle on to help the bike stand up out of the corner.

  A closed throttle moves a motorcycle's weight forward onto the front tire. As that happens, the fork compresses and the bike's steering geometry tightens, encouraging the bike to steer. As the throttle is snuck open to maintenance throttle, the weight moves rearward, coming off the front tire and allowing the fork to extend slightly. As the throttle is then rolled open to on-throttle, the fork extends completely as teh bike's weight is borne mostly by the rear tire. The extended fork helps widen the bike's cornering radius and helps stand the bik up off the corner.
  
  Focus your skill on the fine touch needed to sneak open the throttle after the turn-in. Applying maintenance throttle to arrest the lean angle is a huge reason why some riders continue to miss apexes and overshoot corners, running wide at the exits. These riders get greedy and open the throttle too early while entering the corner, or they open the throttle too hard, skipping maintenance throttle as they jump right to on-throttle. Eitehr mistake prevents the bike from turning down to the apex, but both are also easy to correct: **Leave the throttle shut longer! Don't go to the throttle until the bike has been turned into the corner, and then go to it very gently so teh bike continues to carve the radius you've selected to reach the apex.** So when can you oepn the throttle? As soon as possible after the bike has been turned into the corner. But the earilier you open it, the more smoothly you must open it.
  
  Smoothness is even more important if you have a powerful bike, because a small turn of the right handgrip means a lot of horsepower, especially at high rpm.
  
2. Leg Pressure

  One of the biggest drawbacks to pushing and pulling on the handlebar to turn a motorcycle is the unintended inputs you make when you either sequeeze the grips too tightly or lean your weight onto the handlebar. **One great way to lighten the handlebar's load is to utilize your outside leg to help steer the bike into the corner. By placing the inside of your knee and thigh against the tank, you can apply perssure to help initiate tipping the bike into a corner.**
  
  The truth about this technique is not that you're steering with your knees, but that you're focusing your steering efforts on your legs, not your hands. You are still inputting pressure to the handlebar as you push on the fuel tank with your leg, but because you're focused on your leg movement, your hands are relaxed, and the weight on the handlebar is minimal. The more relaxed you are at the handlebar, the better the ride will be, and this leg presure technique is exactly what many of us need to loosen a too-tight grip.
  
3. Weighting Your Footpegs

  As an "on-board engineer", your ability to move your body maks a huge difference in how your bike works. Placing your weight low and to the inside of the corner helps load the inside foot peg and will allow you to run less lean angle at the same speed.
  
  **To be sure you're loading that inside foot peg, get in the habit of leading the bike into the corner with your chin and, to a lesser extent, the center zipper of your jacket. Be sure the zipper is either centered over the middle of the fuel tank or slightly to the inside, toward the direction you are turning.**
  
  **The timing of this weight change is critical, as is the placement of your weight onto the inside foot peg.** Move your body weight too early, and the bike will fade into the corner before you're ready to commit. Move your body weight too late, and the bike will resist the steering input -- and when it finally comes, it may upset things while you're leaned over. **The difficulty in mastering the body position steering skills lies in the timing of the weight shift onto the inside foot peg.**
  
  For a srong sense of how well weighting a foot peg works, cruise down the road and stand up on your pegs. While standing, life a foot off the peg and notice the bike turn immediately the other way, in the direction of the weighted peg.
  
  Through a set of esses, the timing of your body movements can significantly reduce the steering pressure needed at the handlebar. You'e got a quarter of the total rolling mass moving around on top of the bike. How and when that mass is moved becomes critical to smoothness and to winning races.
  
  **As you begin to experiment with the movement (and the timing of that movement), focus on how you're moving your body. Begin by dipping your head and shoulders into the corner, but start to slide your butt towards the inside of the corner too. Keep your knees in -- save the radical knee out, hanging off, for the racetrack. Take advantage of an inch or two of butt movement to help the bike steer. Be careful not to tug on the handlebar during your weight shifts. Remember, the handlebar make s all significant direction changes, so any input will either alter your course of cause instability. Instead, use your thighs to help move your weight across the seat, with the balls of your feet on the foot pegs. Don't stand up as you move, but use your legs to raise up just engouth so that your butt slides easilly across the seat. You'll find the task much more difficult if you have your heels or arches on the pegs, so concentrate on getting either your toes or the balls of your feet to carry your weight. Riding with your toes or the balls of your feet on the foot pegs provides a more dynamic feel on the bike.**
  
  **Don't confuse body movement with foot peg weighting. You should be able to move your body all over your bike as you cruise down the road in a straight line with both pegs equally weighted, but as soon as you weight a foot peg, the bike will turn.**

### Steering Practice Makes Perfect

Find yourself a clean parking lot or deserted road and focus on steering.

1. Simple push on one of the handgrips at any speed above a walk. Push it slowly. Push it quickly. Push easy. Push hard. Notice how much more effort it takes to steer a bike at 60 mph than at 30 mph.
2. Add a pull on the opposite bar. Really turns quickly, doesn't it? As if you had power steering.
3. Tighten up your stomach and chest muscles, and relax your arms as much as possible. Quit leaning on the bars and hold yourself in position with your torso. Now use the same push and pull movements, but notice that the inputs aren't polluted by the weight of your body.
4. With your torso taut, use your legs to push against the tank, steering the bike with pressure from your knee and thigh. To turn right, push your left knee and inside thigh against the fuel tank. You are still countersteering, but the leg pressure tightens your stomach to support your body and this, in turn, relaxes your arms.
5. Which changing lanes, see how quickly your bike will steer from the upright, straight-aehad position. Change lanes slowly and easily. Change lanes quickly and efficiently. You'll notice that when you change lanes quickly, you must exert pressure to realign the bike in the new lane, but when you change lanes slowly, the bike realigns itself. Those gyros want to go straight.
6. Follow your buddy a a safe distance and mirror her steering inputs while riding down a deserted road. If your buddy flicks the bike right, you flick it right. If she fades left and then snaps the bike upright, do the same. This is a good way to practice your strength and reaction skills.
7. Steer your bike back and forth in second gear with and without the throttle open. Notice how nicely the bike stands up from being leaned over when the throttle is open. Notic how heavy the bike feels when you steer it out of any lean angle without opening the throttle.
8. Continue to steer your bike back and forth a various speeds, and experiment with moving your chest across the gas tank and your weight onto the foot peg in the direction you want to go. Use your thigh muscles to move your butt across the seat, while your toes or the balls of your feet are on the pegs. You'll find it awkward to shift your weight unless your feet are correctly placed on the foot pegs.

### Complicated Course Alterations

**Steering technique is all about smooth combinations.** Push on the handlebar, push on the tank with your outside leg, lean your weight onto the inside foot peg and don't forget to use that throttle correctly. **The best riders do these things almost automatically, yet they worked hard on integrating the skills. The bottom line is you must understand countersteering and how pushing and pulling on the handlebar turns the motorcycle. This must become second nature to you, ingrained and understood, just like the proper use of your eyes. Then you begin adding the little touches, like exact throttle control, a bit of outsdie leg, a small weight shift.** Next thing you know, people are either telling you how smoothly you ride on the street, or they're handling you trophies at the racetrack.

### Lessons From The Racktrack

- **Fitness** The physical challenge of steering a fast-moving race bike stresses a rider's torso, legs, arms and neck, as well as his cardiovascular fitness. You can bet your riding will imporove as you drop fat and gain muscle. Racers focus on sit-ups and push-ups as well as plenty of legwork to allow them to move around the bike without pushing and pulling on the handlebar. Jogging, riding dirt bikes, mountain biking -- aynthing that adds leg strength is a good way to increase strength for riding.
- **Body Weight Timing** Since body movement radically affects a light race bike's handling, racers must leanr to time their weight shift just right. Get it right, and the body weight change perfectly matches the steering input, and the bike feels as if it is turning itself.
- **More Body, Less Lean Angle** Watch your favorite MotoGP star and observe his corner exit. The rider will stand the bike up off the apex by actuaaly leaning farther off the inside of the bike. It's a subtle move, but this technique allows the bike to maintain the radius needed to execute the turn yet remain more uprgiht for better traction using the meat of the rear tire. Street riders can use this technique if you're surprised by a lane full of gravel when you need to make a turn. Hanging farther off the motorcycle allows the same cornering radius with less lean angle.
- **Steering Dampers** A steering damper controls unwanted motion of the steering head. When accelerating over a rough section of pavement, it's not uncommon for the handlebar to oscillate quickly, or head-shake. The damper prevents this flopping back and forth. Properly set up, a steering damper should hav little or no effect during normal riding. You should be able to feel its drag when you force the handlebar side-to-side while at a standstill, but having it set too tight will affect straight-line stability, the same way too-tight sterring-stem bearings feel. *Not many street bikes need them, but most high-performance sport bikes and all rce bikes do and, like suspension components, they will benefit from timely rebuilds.*

## 5) On The Gas

- The more horsepower your bike makes, the slower your throttle hand must move.
- With the performance of sport bikes these days, wide-open throttle is pretty spectacular. But like a contemporary motorcycle's powerful brakes, the throttle must be treated like a rheostat, not an on/off switch. Roll it on and off, don't stab it.
- Abrupt throttle movements make passengers miserable, no matter what you ride or drive. Smoothing and slowing your right hand while riding your bike, or your right foot while driving your car, will make everyon more comfortable.

The throttle is so easy to twist, and its results so hard to control. Any idiot can accelerate hard. The real chanllenge is mastering the other aspects that exact throttle management brings to your riding. **Used skillfully, the twist grip is more than an accelerator, because it helps you change the bike's direction.**

As discussed in chapter 4, the throttle is also a steering device. You enter most corners off the throttle and on the brakes. A motorcycle turns better if the throttle is closed slightly, inducing the forward weight transfer, which aids in at least the direction change by loading the front tire and collapsing the fork. Also, a slowing motorcycle will continue to fall into the corner, so that closed throttle really helps to get a bike steered.

The aacelerating throttle and resultant extended fork make your bike hesitant to steer simply because your bike's front-end geometry is a its most stable and lease flickable (steerable). Roll off teh throtle, and then the fork compresses and the bike becomes more willing to turn. You're actually adjusting your front steering geometry, taking advantage of the throttle's effect on weight transfer, to help steer the bike. Sure, you can force a bike to steer into a corner with the throttle open, but it will take longer (time and distance) to reach your desired apex. **Make a habit of closing the throttle a corner entrances. This should work out perfectly, since that's also a great place to use the brakes to set your entrance speed.**

### Between Off And On

Focus on closing the throttle in a smooth, controlled manner, because that's the only way to calm your fingers as they squeeze the brake lever. Begin training your right hand to always move in a controlled, smooth manner. Your destiny rides in your right hand.

### Drill Time: Go Slow-Mo

Start slower: first gear. Take your bike out on a deserted street or parking lot and accelerate and decelerate in first gear, using various rpm. Roll the throttle on and off slowly at first, just easing it open and easing it closed. Really concentrate on your right hand, finessing the grip open and closed. As you get smoother, increase the rpm and try to roll the throttle on and off just as smoothly, but more quickly. **Find the point at which you can quickly open and cloes the throttle while maintaining smoothness.** This skill must be practiced constantly to overcome our inherent instainct to be more aggressive when trying to excel in sports.

**Get in the habit of never rushing either movement, no matter what you ride or drive. It's vital that you master this and make it part of your vehicle operation because as you begin to go faster (and use more lean angle), loading those tires' contact patches is all about smoothness.**

### Close But Not Closed: Remember Maintaince Throttle

You enter a corner off the throttle, with much of the weight of the bike on the front tire as it leans into the corner. **If overloaded, the front tire will lose traction**, so you must learn to ease the throttle open just enough to transfer some weight off the front tire, but not enough to actually accelerate the bike. We call this *maintaince throttle*.

The reason for sneaking on the throttle is two-fold. A) throttle will make the bike cease steering into the corner, so if you turn your bike into the corner and grab some throttle, it will be tough to make the apex. B) if you grab the throttle a lean angle, it's very possible to overwhelm the rear tire's traction as it deals with cornering and acceleration forces. The crach that results is called a *high-side*: The bike slides sideways, then the tire abruptly grabs traction, stops slideing, and the rider is launched over the high side.

**This neutral throttle, or maintenance throttle, will arrest and hold constant the bike's lean angle, unload the front tire slightly, load the rear tire gently and give the bike an amazingly balanced feel. Remember, this is just enough throttle to unload the front tire and maintain the lean angle.**

- When bike is in lean angle, the rear tire is busy dealing with lean angle points, so the rider can't afford to add additional acceleration points and risk overwhelming the tire's available traction. This is where maintenance throttle comes in, delivered with a slow right hand.
- For tire, more rubber on the road equals more traction, so think about sneaking open the throttle to load the rear tire before beginning serious acceleration.
- The initial throttle application must be super-slow and smooth because the rear tire's contact patch increases significantly as the bike's weight transfers rearward. Think about pressing the rear tire into the pavement before acceleration, not just snapping on the throttle.

### The Rear Tire And 100 Points Of Traction

For a rear tire, there are 100 points divided between providing acceleration and providing cornering traction. With teh bike straight up and down, all 100 points are applied to acceleration traction. But as th bike leans into a corner, the same tire's acceleration points are traded for cornering traction points. As the bike gets to full lean and the rear tire is steered onto its edge, most of the traction points are given to cornering traction with very few left for acceleration.

If the rider leans the bike into a corner and uses 97 points for cornering traction and then asks for 5 points of acceleration traction, this can result in a subtle slip or a hard-hitting high-side.

It doesn't matter whether you add too many acceleration points while leaned over or add too many cornering points while aceleration: *Ayny combination that adds up to over 100 points is going to cause a slide*.

### Picking Up The Throttle

After you've rolled the throttle shut smoothly and turned the bike into the corner, it's time to start your drive off the corner by going to maintenance throttle to arrest and hold the bike's lean angle.

- Imagine the slightest turn of the throttle, just easing it up off the idle stop.
- Imagine the throttle cables just barely tightening up.
- Imagine moving the carburetor slides or fuel-injection throttle bodies just a fraction of a hair.
- Imagine just tricking some fuel into the combustion chamber

**Because that's the type of throttle feel that the best riders in the world possess.**

When to start seaking the throtle open is: **Do it as soon as possible after the bike changes direction.** The earlier you begin sneaking the throttle open, the smoother and finer you must be on the twist grip, because your rear tire is using most of its 100 points for cornering traction. The farther you lean your bike into the corner, the more gently you must add acceleration.

The fastest racers in the world have the finest feel in their right hands. They're leaning way over, yet still have enough sensitivity to add the one or two acceleration traction points to keep the rear tire at 100 points of traction. A good way to think about it is this: **fast bike, slow hand**.

After reaching full lean angle, you'll soon begin standing the bike up to exit the corner. As you stand your bike up off the edge of the tire, acceleration traction points become available as you give back conering traction points. That means you can roll the throttle open gently and smoothly as the bike stands up off the corner. This answer the question of when to accelerate in a corner: **Only when you see the exit and can begin to take away lean angle**.

It's entirely possible to open the throttle too early. The secret to correct throttle application is to **allow the bike to steer into the corner off-throttle and wait until the bike has pointed itself into the corner before you sneak the throttle open**. A sure sign that a rider is accelerating too soon is that the bike continues to run wide in slow corners. The rider gets impatient because the corner is slow, pulls the throttle open, and that action extends the fork and lets the bike run wide. **Keep the throttle shut until the bike is steered in, and then begin easing it open**.

### Throttle Drill

**On you next ride, roll off the throttle in slow motion the very first time you need to decelerate. Take lots of time and distance to slowly shut the throttle, completely focusing on the smooth, slow rotation of the throttle. Get your brain focused on your right hand**.

**Pay special attention to how quickly your right hand moves. If you slam off the throttle, you will almost surely grab at the brake. Focus on rolling off the throttle smoothly and notice how it smooths the transition to braking**.

**You should also pay special attention to how quickly the front end dives under deceleration. If you chop the throttle quickly, the front end will drop correspondingly. If you ease off the throttle, notice how much more smoothly the front moves**.

**While riding at highway speeds, try different gears to experience how much more difficult it is to manipulate the throttle smoothly at higher rpm. In top gear, the throttle response is relatively sluggish when compared to third gear at the same speed. It's fairly easy to be smooth when the engine's not making much power, but the real challenge is maintaining that smoothness at hgih rpm**.

**Listen to your bike's drive chain as you accelerate and decelerate in top gear. Can you hear it clunk? Try and smooth your right hand's movements until your bike's drive chain can no longer be heard**.

## 6) Brakes

If you're looking for one riding skill to truly master, choose braking.

**Once again, your right hand is the focal point when it comes to imporving your braking skills**.

### Your Buddy, The Brakes

Most of riders could accelerate well, but when it came to curbing their speed, the difference in stopping distances was as varied as the types fo motorcycle ridden. **The bikes had almost nothing to do with the variance. It all came down to the fingers squeezing the brakes and the minds operating the fingers**. As with all rider inputs, the name of the games is **SMOOTHNESS**.

**Apply the brakes gradually, feel the transfer of weight to the front, and then really increase the pressure that you apply to the front and rear brakes. The process needs to happen quickly and in a controlled manner.**

Rider skill at the front brake lever was significantly more important than the model of bike, brand of tire or brake pad compound when it came to separating those who could consistently stop a motorcycle in a short distance from those who simply grabbed and hoped.

By squeezing the front brake lever to begin the braking process, you allow the motrocycle's weight to transfer smoothly to the front end, compressing the fork slightly and loading the tire. After this initial smooth equeeze, the brakes can be applied with vigor.

Grab the brake too aggressively and the front tire can lock before the bike's weight has a chance to shift forward. Beating the weight transfer like this will immediately lock the tire and perhaps lead to a crash. To help remember to queeze, you can paly with the spelling of weight: **Wait on the weight transfer**.

**Spend time and thought on squeezing the front brake lever, and make it a habit every time you go to the brakes.**

### Finding The Threshold Of Lock-Up

After the initial squeeze, bear down on the brake lever and get a feel for how well your bike stops. Listen for the tire to talk to you, because at maximum deceleration the front tire will howl slightly. **The main technique you should master is attaining a total focus on the pressure of your right hand fingers**.

**As your confidence improves, you will be able to either skid the front tire momentarily or allow the rear end of your bike to lift off the ground, depending upon the bike you're riding**. When either occurs, immediately but smoothly release only enough pressure to unlock the wheel or lower the back end. If you get scared and completely release the brake lever, your braking distances will be significantly longer.

What you're experimenting with is *threshold braking*, or braking to the verge of locking the wheels. This is the outer limit of straight-line braking, and I suggest you become comforable there.

**When applying the rear brake, use the toes of your right foot on the brake pedal, and use them lightly, with as much feel as you can muster**. The secret to the rear brake is **use it, don't abuse it**. Make sure to leave the heel of your foot on the foot peg and simply flex the ankle forward and down. if you take your foot off the peg and place it on the brake pedal, you can easily lose feel, and the brake can immediately lock.

If you ride at 120 mph, you had better practice braking from 120 mph. Find a place to do a few high-speed emergency stops; that experiment will oepn your eyes to the difficulty of stopping a bike from high speed. The distance it takes to stop your bike may have you rethinking your Sunday morning speed.

### Trail-Braking Needs Smooth Hands

Once you begin trailing your brakes into the corners, you will be convinced that **a tire can handle the combination of braking and cornering**. That's an important concept to realize, because someday you will be surprised by a mid-corner emergency.

Trail-braking is the answer: **keep your eyes focused on where you want the bike to go, and continue to trail-brake. As your speed comes down, your radius will tighten, allowing you to stand the bike up -- that means you can brake even harder. Never give up on the brakes when your entrance speed is too high**.

But trail-braking is not an elixir, err on the side of safety by setting corner entrance speed early and not relying on heavy trail-braking deep into a turn. You have no runoff room on public highways if your get it wrong.

### Brakes And A Blip

Two fingers on the front brake lever, and the remaining two fingers and thumb will be wrapped around the throttle grip to turn, or blip, the throttle on the downshift. *The tough part is maintaining constant pressure on the front brake lever while blipping the throttle.*

On your first few attempts, you'll find yourself pulling and releasing the brake lever. This creates a pogoing front fork assembly during downshifts, but stick with it. Whatever you do, **don't quit trying to blip the throttle on the downshifts while braking**, because botching a downshift while slightly leaned over can momentairily lock the rear tire, and that's the last thing you want to have happen. Time your clutch re-engagement to take best advantage of the blip, allowing the lower gear to be selected smoothly and consistently.

Braking and downshifting simultaneously isn't dificult from a skills perspective, but it is difficult from a timing perspective. **The goal is to bring the engine up to speed using the throttle while the clutch is disengaged and the downshift is being made. Remember to release that clutch smoothly and control the lever all the way out, because it is your final safety net in the downshift procedure.** If you accidentally downshift twice, or are unsure of which gear you are in, the habit of letting the clutch engate smoothly will be a lifesaver.

### Coming To Terms With The Rear Brake

As the front brake is applied, the bike transfers weight forward onto the front tire and off the rear tire. With less weight on the rear tire, the rear brake becomes increasingly touchy and prone to locking.

Studies prove that **a combination of the front and rear braking will stop a bike more quickly and in lss distance that just using the front brake**. Many riders have found that applying the rear brake nanoseconds before the front brake helps settle the bike because the rear suspension isn't so eager to rebound, a trait that helps reduce the forward weight transfer.

A mid-corner touch of rear brake helps hold the bike's lin down to the apex, shedding that last bit of speed without upsetting the chassis. It's especially easy in a left-hand corner but will require preparing your foot position at teh corner entrance. Right-hand turns are trickier because you could catch your foot on the pavement.

### Use It, But Lightly

Correctly using the rear brake mid-corner is a great way to scrub speed safely. A touch of rear brake slows the bike well without throwing the weight forward, which would happen if you squeezed the front brake lever. Weight will transfer forward even when using the rear brake, but the fork compression and tire loading will be decidedly different, and safer.

### Is This Slick?

The rear brake makes an excellent traction sampler during straight-line riding. **Learn to apply it and then increase the pressure until it locks momentarily, telling you how much traction a particular road surface is offering**. *When it stars raining, I ofter use the rear brake to gauge the traction.* You'll develop a feel for how the rear wheel locks and slides, including the sound it produces, which will help your riding considerably. This little pavement test must be done with the bike completely upright and at sane speed, and the rear tire should remain locked only momentarily to avoid the problem of the rear end sliding to one side or the other. **If you squeeze down on the rear brake pedal smoothly, the impending lockup will give you a huge amount of traction information**.

Locking the rear brake can and will happen, and there are 2 ways to deal with it. **The first** is to immediately reduce the perssure at the brake pedal before the locked tire slides left or right. **The second** methods is to leave the brake locked and simply steer the front wheel slightly to compensate for the locked rear wheel. If you gently steer straight, the bike will come to a stop and you'll stay upright. In an all-out panic stop, a locked rear brake might be the elast of your worries as you modulate the front and try to steer to a safe spot. However, an unlocked rear tire and a skillful right foot will actually prove more helpful in stopping your bike in a shortest distance, so educate that foot and practice threshold braking.

## 7) All About Enviornment

You should plan and imagine the next ride well before slipping on a riding jacket and helment. Get your brain started early works for the next ride.

This chapter is all about judgement.

### Check Your Speed

Where are you going and whats the schedule? Many of us simply ride fast all the time, no matter what. **That's a bad habit, not simply because of tickets, but also because of safety**. Save speeding for making meetings with the company president or for enjoying your favorite canyon road, river run or back-country twisty.

### Tires

- Better not ride in rain
- Be aware of tire wears

### The Environment Of Corners: Finding The Good Line

For different bikes and persons the answer varies. The good line for a fully landen touring bike will differ singnificantly forrom a line that works weill for a wieldy 600 sport bike. Lean angle, corner radius, speed, cornering clearance, road surface, traffic and traction must all be figured into the mix, plus the most important ingredient -- the rider's ability.

### Radius === MPH, MPH === Radius, Radius === Safety

The wider the radius of a corner, the faster you can ride through it at a given lean angle, or the less lean angle you need at a given speed.

Open the radius of any corner means more braking and accelerating points, also it means less lean angle, which equals safer and feels more comfortable.

### Wide Entrance Line

Wide entrance line allows the rider to see farther into the corner before committing to the corner. Since the bike is upright longer, any visual surprises can be dealt with by simply braking harder or farther into the corner, it gives you a better view before the bike has to be leaned over.

But wide entrance line requires the perfection of your steering skills. It makes you to turn in less time and less distance than a early turn. That means if you turn late, you must turn *efficiently* or you'll miss the corner. **Your ability to turn the bike will help dictate the corner-entrance point, as will your bike's tires, steering geometry, wheelbase and weight**.

Notice the word *efficient*. Not quick, flick, hammer, throw. **You're going to squeeze the brakes and smoothly roll on the throttle, so carry those methods to adding lean angle points as well**. Yes, certain corners require quicker steering, but keep efficiency in mind and don't simply throw your bike into a corner. Do not grab the brakes, yank on the throttle or throw the bike into the corner, because you want to add and remove traction points in a controlled manner. You can add traction points quickly, but no suddenly. There's a big difference.

### Entrance To Apex And Beyond

An apex is simply the point where you get closest to the right edge of your lane in a right-hand corner, or to the left edge in a left-hand corner. **In a corner, a good line will almost always feature a "late" apex, meaning that the bike comes closest to the edge of the lane farther around the corner**.

### Early Apex

**If you find yourself adding lean angle after the apex just to stay in your lane, you have turned too early**. A bike should be at maximum lean angle at or just before the apex of a corner, and it's at this apex that the drive off the corner should be underway. In other words, you should be standing your bike up off the corner at or just past the apex, putting the meat of the rear tire to work. At the apex, the tire is giving the majority of its 100 rear tire points to cornering traction, so the bike must be stood up as the power is rolled on. **The rider who apexes early and adds lean angle after the apex just to stay in his lane will find a world of trouble if he also tries to accelerate off the apex**.

A nice wide, controlled entrance makes a good apex possible. If you get the bike out of shape entering the corner, it's easy to miss the apex, or run wide of the apex, by a few feet or more because your lack of control delayed the turning of the bike. Missing the apex by a few feet effectively makes the road more narow, reducing the amount of radius and pavement you can take advantage of. As you have learned, that means you must go more slowly or lean over more jsut to make a given corner.

Since the apex of a corner generally represents the point of maximum lean angle, it becomes a reference point to help determine when to begin the drive off the corner. There might be corners where you brake right past teh apex because a tighter corner follows immediately, but getting the apex will give you the ability to select the necessary control for the upcoming future. **At the apex of a corner, you should be able to see the exit of the corner, and your eyes should find the point of maximum exit radius**. Missing the apex by a few inches or a few yards removes a confidence-inspiring reference point and will delay acceleration. Nail the apex will become simple to pick the bike up and accelerate away. **Get your bike down to the apex of a corner, it's safer and faster**.

Get your apex right so you can use all the pavement at the exit. For street riders in a narrow lane, using the available pavement is even more important.

### Overly Late Apex

An early apex throws the bike at the yellow or white line at a very steep angle, requiring the rider to lean over just to stay in the lane. In contrast, a rider making a late apex will never reach the yellow or white line at the exit because his turn-in was so late that the bike's momentum simply carries it off the corner on a low exit line. The problem with the overly late apex is that the rider makes every corner much tighter that it really is, forcing hime to either go more slowly than necessary or to lean over farther that necessary.

### Decresing-Radius Corners

Use trail-brake. Radius equals mph. Reducing the bike's speed and thus tightening the turning radius. If necessary, the brakes can be used right down to the apex, a helpful technique when hustling along an unknown road.

### Get The Apex

Every corner has an apex, and every corner will be better if you can somehow increase its radius. Gravel, bumps and potholes might limit your line choices, but the habit of reaching your deepest lean angle at or just before the apex is a safe and smart way to ride. It's also safe and fast, speed is a bonus when the bike is in the right place.

**Stick with positioning the bike for a wide entrace. Look for the apexes and judge whether your chosen apex was too early (if you needed to add more lean angle after the apex just to make the corner), or too late because you found yourself exiting the corner on the inside, without the bike wanting to stand up off the corner. Get the apex right, and the bike practically rides itself**.
